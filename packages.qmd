You can download the packages used in *Bayesian Demographic Estimation and Forecasting* from the [Stats New Zealand github repo](https://github.com/statisticsnz/).

We are, however, building a new suite of packages that are faster and more user-friendly. We suggest you take a look at [bage](https://github.com/bayesiandemography/bage).
